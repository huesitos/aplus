      review_title:				"Review process"
      rcard1_front:				"Welcome to Effdy! This is a sample topic we added to help you learn how review your cards. Click the button 'Flip' to flip this card!"
      rcard1_back:				"When reviewing your cards you will see the front side of the card first, which is the side where you should write the question. The back side is for the answer. Whenever you are looking at the back side, two buttons will appear: one for signilizing you answered the question correctly, and the other for when you answer it incorrectly. Now click either the 'Correct' or 'Incorrect' button to continue."

      rcard2_front:				"When reviewing, you should read the question, and think of the answer. See the 'Your answer' box in the side? It's there in case the answer to the question is too long to remember correctly, like a list of things. For instance, say you have the question: Name all states/provinces of your country. Use the box in the side to help you answer the question. When you are done, flip the card."
      rcard2_back:				"In this side there should be the answer of the question in the front side. You can compare the answer you wrote with the real answer. However, you are the one that must decide whether your answer is 'Correct' or 'Incorrect'. We'll explain the meaning of the buttons in the next card."

      rcard3_front:				"Whenever you answer a card correctly, the 'level' of understanding of that card raises. A card with a high level of understanding is a card you shouldn't be reviewing frequently. In contrast, when you answer a card incorrectly, the level is decreased, so that you get to see it more often."
      rcard3_back:				"The app will use the level of the card to calculate an approximated review date. The topics that should be reviewied today are listed in the review calendar page. The review calendar page also includes a week review projection. Flashcard's review date is generated using what the topic current 'recall percentage'. In the next card we explain what that is."

      rcard4_front:				"The topic 'recall percentage' means 'how much percentage of the information is recalled'. For example, say you want to review a card before you forget more than 10% of it, then you'd set the topic's recall percentage to 90%. Don't worry if it's complicated to understand right now. Click flip to continue."
      rcard4_back:				"You can edit each topic's 'recall percentage' in the topic's edit page. The default value is 80%. If you set it higher than, review dates will be closer to each other, if you set it lower, review dates will be more sparced."

      rcard5_front:				"This is most of what you have to know about the reviewing process. There is another topic that covers the basic app navigation and page description."
      rcard5_back:					"For now, here's a quick summary of the main menu: the first option is the review schedule, which shows what topics you have to review today and also projects the topic to review a week from now; the second option is the subjects list, and the third is the topic's list. After you answer this question you'll be sent to this topic's show page where you can edit, delete, and add cards."

      navigation_title:		"Basic navigation and features"
      ncard1_front:				"Welcome to Effdy! This is a sample topic we added to help you learn how to use the basic functionalities of the app and make your study sessions more effective. Click the button 'Flip' to flip this card!"
      ncard1_back:				"Well done! The main navigation bar to the left has the following options: the review schedule link, the subjects lit, and the topics, list. We'll be covering the details of each one in the next cards. Click either correct or incorrect."

      ncard2_front:				"The review schedule lists the topics that have to be reviewed, the number of cards, and the approximated time it will take to review them. The approximated time is calculated based on the sum of the duration in seconds of how much it takes you to answer each card of a topic. The default time is 1 minute per card. Also, there's a 'Week review' projection where you can see, a week in advance, which flascards you'll have to study."
      ncard2_back:				"Only flascards from topics that are set for reviewing will appear in the calendar. You can set a topic for reviewing with the 'Review' button in the topics list page or inside a topic. To unset the reviewing, click the 'Reviewing' button again."

      ncard3_front:				"Topics serve to contain flashcards related to a single idea. If you have several topics which are also related you can group them within a subject. The Subjects option in the main menu lists all your subjects and you can add new subjects with the add button there. The Topics option in the main menu lists all your topics and you can also add new topics with the add button there. In both pages, you can delete both elements."
      ncard3_back:				"In the Subjects and Topics page you can delete subjects or topics respectively. Subjects can also be deteled with its topics with the 'Delete all' option."

      ncard4_front:				"Inside the topic's and subject's page new options will appear in the main menu. The topic's first option is a page listing all its cards. The first subject's option is a page listing all its topics. Both have a second option linking to their edit page."
      ncard4_back:				"Finally, you can send copies of your topics and subjects or add collaborators to help you create content in them. When you send a copy of an element, whatever changes the receptor does to the element wont affect yours. However, if you add them as collaborators, both of you share the same content and will see the changes. Collaborators can't delete topics or subjects, but can delete cards."
